To remove the prussic acid from manioc, the Kuikuru grate them and squeeze the pulp through a mat strainer into a flat bottomed pot.

Life centers around planting rice—months are named according to paddy farming activities. They also plant cash crops like rubber, pepper, cocoa, pumpkin, corn, cucumber, and cotton for weaving. They were originally animist in belief, although many have converted to Islam and Christianity. Shamans serve to connect heaven, earth, and the underworld, and heal the sick by retrieving their souls, which have wandered into the land of the dead. Their decision-making depends on interpreting omens and divination.
