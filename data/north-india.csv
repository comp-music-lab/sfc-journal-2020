In his original notes, Danielou gives the background of the Ah¥r community as follows: “When the Aryans invaded India many centuries before Christ, the defeated people were allotted certain professions and thus were allowed to survive, maintaining their culture and religion to a great extent. The ancient and proud Abh¥r¢as, now called Ah¥rs, have thus been milkmen and cowherds for centuries and have kept alive forms of songs, dance, and epic poetry similar to those of many centuries ago.” Danielou was very attracted to the music of the Ah¥rs and produced an LP of their music in 1951 that was republished in 1984. The term virahå or birahå is now given to a broad classification of songs, while this form of virahå is more precisely known as kha®¥ birahå. This is a special style of song developed by the Ah¥r cowherders ostensibly to communicate with other herders and their distant villages while pasturing their animals. The antiquity of the Ah¥r community is corroborated by the fact that they are referred to (as ÅAbh¥ra cowherds) in the Råmåyaˆa and the Mahåbhårata epics dating from several centuries B.C.E. There is no way to establish the contention that they are pre-Aryans, especially as the texts of their kha®¥ birahås usually refer, as in this case, to the Aryan epic, Råmåyaˆa. Other references in their songs are evidently to their own myths, which could predate the Aryan invasions.",@CFPM1955India,Compiled and edited by Alain Daniélou; New liner notes by Amy Catlin and Nazir Jairazbhoy,Gangetic Plain,1952

The swing hangs from the branch of the Kadamba tree,
Krishn¢a and Rådhå, his beloved, swing, swing.
The rope is of green silk and the boy is dressed in green.
Her sari is purple and in her green palanquin
Among all her maids her beauty cannot be described.
Green green is the milkman’s boy 
And green the branch of the Kadamba tree.
How seductive is Krishn¢a, he steals our hearts,
And our minds dissolve in him ...

The musical structure is that of a leader with a chorus that repeats the whole or part of the leader’s verse. Melodically, the song has two themes, with the second part being pitched higher than the first, somewhat like the sthåy¥-antrå form of classical music. The second theme has a range of a sixth and does not reach the upper octave as in the antrå:

In his hair the Ganges plays,
And seated on his lap,
The White-Goddess* caresses him.

Holding in his hand the garland of skulls,
Day and night he drinks the cup of poison [hashish],
His drum roaring “dama, dama”

And seated on his lap,
The White-Goddess caresses him.

Wearing at his waist the skin of a beast,
A scorpion tied as an armlet,
This merciless youth spends his life,

And seated on his lap,
The White-Goddess caresses him.

Singing the virtues of the Teacher
And counting hardships
Shall be your daily consolation,
Meditating on the Mountain’s Goddess,

And seated on his lap,
The White Goddess caresses him.

Groups of wandering mendicants who travel from one shrine to another singing devotional songs (bhajans) are found to this day. This is rather an unusual ensemble of wandering ascetics, principally because the stringed instrument identified in the title as an ekatårå, a drone instrument, actually appears to be a fretted sitar, as can be heard on the record and seen in the photograph. A sitår with its many strings is normally much too delicate an instrument to be carted around from village to village, especially in the heat of Rajasthan, while a spiked lute ektår¢a that plays only a drone is much more usual. The musicians are probably not monks, but novices training to become ordained at some shrine or and other where they generally will return once a year.",@CFPM1955India,Compiled and edited by Alain Daniélou; New liner notes by Amy Catlin and Nazir Jairazbhoy,N W India,1953
