The language is Malayalam.

Kathaka¬i is a classical form of sacred dance drama sung in Malayalam, the Tamil-derived vernacular language of Kerala State in southwestern India. Kathaka≥i is rooted in the temple genre of Kerala known as K¨†iyå††am, India’s only surviving traditional Sanskrit theater form, whose history goes back over 1500 years. In reaction to disturbances caused by the Portuguese occupation of the Kerala coast, a bhakti (Hindu devotional) movement arose in sixteenth century Kerala. This in turn gave rise to the creation of vernacular literary texts, including several plays written in south Kerala in the late sixteenth century based on religious stories from the Råmåyaˆa epic. This form, known as Råmanå††am (“Råma drama”), gradually evolved and was renamed Kathaka¬i (“story play”) in the 18th century, when new plays were written and performed based on the Mahåbhårata epic. The author of these plays was a prince of north Kerala who greatly expanded the depth of expression (bhåva) and characterization, developed the use of numerous rågas and tålas for their emotional impact, and enhanced the costuming, makeup and staging. Today’s highly sophisticated and virtuosic Kathaka¬i is performed by male musicians and actors whose lives are dedicated to perfecting their art.

This extract presents the mythological king DakΩa, the embodiment of creative power, competence, and intelligence born of Brahma himself. He is said to have had a vast number of daughters, including Sati, who eventually committed suicide because of a disagreement between her father and her husband, Íiva. In this kathaka¬i play, the playwright offers a psychological explanation for the family tensions that led to Sati’s suicide by fire; her father’s contempt and derision because of her devotion to Lord Íiva.

In this extract, the four percussionists first play a prelude in six beats, which serves as entrance music for the actor. The lead singer then sings DakΩa’s lines, accusing Sati of sin and impurity, and expelling her from his sacrificial hall. His lines are aggressively set to the bold contours of a pentatonic råga called Såra∫ga, which does not resemble the Såra∫ga of either North or South Indian classical music but uses the following five notes and is similar to the South Indian råga Mohanam:
                        
C   D   E   G   A   c

 This is performed in a medium-tempo seven beat cycle called Tripu†a:
Claps:                     X              O
                1    2    3    4    5    6    7
Drum syllables:     ta   ki   †a   ta   ka   di   mi

The actor meanwhile mimes the text. The first line is repeated to allow the actor to execute variations in his facial expressions and gestures. The percussionists then play an interlude for the actor to execute additional movements. Then two half-lines are sung, after each of which one or two accompanying voice(s) join in repetitions, concluding with the repetition of the opening line. The percussionists intervene with a second interlude, until the voice for the female character Sati mournfully emerges, accompanied in muted strokes in a slow seven-beat cycle. She warns her father that his opposition to Lord Shiva, to whom she is devoted, will bring on his wrath. Sati’s pathetic plea is aptly set to Punnagavarå¬¥ råga with its languorous ornaments and minor intervals:

                        C    Db    Eb    F    G    Ab    Bb    c

The third degree (E) is, however, extremely low and actually sounds only a half step above the lowered second degree, as in some South Indian classical rågas. Each line is repeated except the final fourth line, which is interrupted by a percussion interlude heralding DakΩa’s furious response in rapid seven-beat cycles of Muri a†aˆ†a tå¬a (similar to Tripu†a tåla, but faster), set to Kedåragau¬a råga with its pentatonic ascent and heptatonic descent:

        C    D    F    G    Bb    c              c    Bb    A    G    F    E    D    C

After he repeats two lines threatening to call his slaves to oust Sati, the percussionists accelerate the tempo for his climactic dance of rage.",13.08,80.27,,,Tamil,Orchestra of the dancer Gopinath,Columbia World Library of Folk and Primitive Music: India.
